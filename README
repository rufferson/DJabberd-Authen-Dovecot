This authentication plugin uses Dovecot's SASL mechanism
to validate user's credentials. By default it tries to
connect to /var/run/dovecot/auth-client socket and sub-
mits authentication challenge using Dovecot's protocol.

Only PLAIN mechanism works so far, should not be a prob-
lem over encrypted TLS channel which is already de-facto
standard in modern communications.

Example configuration section:

  <Plugin DJabberd::Authen::Dovecot>
    Realm djabberd
    Socket /var/lib/djabber/dovecot-sasl
  </Plugin>

Note: Dovecot by default sets restrictive permissions on
the socket so if you need to run djabberd as an unprivi-
leged user (good idea after all) you need to configure
the socket in dovecot and Authen section.
